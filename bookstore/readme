A Book publishing company wants to automate the process of managing book details and its author details.

The Book Management System has to support the following tasks:

Insert new book and its author details

Search books based on

                  - author-name

                  - book title

                  - book title and author-name

View all books in ascending order based on book price

Remove book based on book Id

Update book price based on book Id

Note: Every search operation has to display complete book information except the book id on the console.

Create an application to perform the specified database operations using NamedParameterJdbcTemplate of Spring and also implement the required exception handling using Spring Data Access Exception.
